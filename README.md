# desktop-changer
This is a program that I run on init so that my desktop changes every hour on the dot. it cycles through a directory I have given and updates my config file.

# How to use and download 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/starless333/desktop-changer
cd desktop-changer/
make
./main /path/to/swaybg/config /path/to/wallpaper/directory
```
**Note that this was made to be run on init. And this may vary from machine to machine, but getting it set up should not be hard.**
